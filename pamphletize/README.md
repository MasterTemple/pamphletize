# Pamphletize

Create easy-to-print 8.5"x11" pamphlet from an 8.5"x5.5" PDF.

- Adds necessary blank pages (to make it a multiple of 4)
- Reorders the pag
- Merges pages into 1 page

> Would you like me to modify it so the inside pages are mirrored (for proper back/front folding alignment) — i.e., page order alternates like a real folded booklet?
